    <p>From the security perspective, we need developers and engineers to
&#8220;think more securely&#8221;. However, this is easier said than done. We need
to first address several important&nbsp;issues:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>What does &#8220;think security&#8221; mean and how does one use&nbsp;it?</li>
<li>How can the concepts of &#8220;think security&#8221; be distilled and&nbsp;taught?</li>
</ol>
<div class="section" id="explaining-the-security-mentality">
<h2>Explaining the Security&nbsp;Mentality</h2>
<p>I am only starting to examine the first&nbsp;issue:</p>
<blockquote>
What is it about the mindset of a security professional that
distinguishes them from developers and other professions?</blockquote>
<p>Maybe a good place to start is looking at other methods of thought, such
as <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking">critical thinking</a> or the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method">Socratic method</a>. One well-known modern
teacher of thought, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_de_Bono">Edward de Bono</a>, breaks the thought space into
three general types of&nbsp;thinkers:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Horizontal&nbsp;Thinkers:</dt>
<dd>Creative thinkers that focus more on abstract ideas and fantasy,
including artists and&nbsp;designers</dd>
<dt>Vertical&nbsp;Thinkers</dt>
<dd>Critical thinkers that use deductive reasoning to solve problems,
such as engineers and software&nbsp;developers</dd>
<dt>Lateral&nbsp;Thinkers</dt>
<dd><p class="first"><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Sideways thinkers&#8221; who use more creative problem solving techniques
and are capable of freeing their thoughts from common thought biases
and&nbsp;assumptions</p>
<p class="last">Lateral thinkers can be thought of as a combination of both
horizontal and vertical&nbsp;thinkers</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<object data="/static/images/lateral-thinking.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
Planes of Thought</object>
<p>de Bono&#8217;s portrayal of <em>lateral thinkers</em> has many similarities to
common traits of security professionals &#8212; they are capable of
approaching problems in innovative ways to find new security&nbsp;weaknesses.</p>
<div class="section" id="lateral-thinking-puzzles">
<h3>Lateral Thinking&nbsp;Puzzles</h3>
<p>Examples of lateral thinking are best highlighted in lateral thinking,
or scenario, puzzles. In these puzzles, you are presented with a
situation and you must find a solution for under which circumstances the
situation can be reasonably&nbsp;explained.</p>
<p>The trick to these puzzles is that there is no deducible solution to the
problem. That is, the solution cannot be reached using only the
information and assumptions based on the&nbsp;puzzle.</p>
<p>Here is a common example of a lateral thinking&nbsp;puzzle:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">A man walks into a bar and asks for a drink.</div>
<div class="line">The bartender pulls out a gun and points it at him.</div>
<div class="line">The man says, &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; and walks out.</div>
</div>

puzzles, visit <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rinkworks.com/brainfood/p/latreal1.shtml">Brain Food</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="schneier-s-law">
<h2>Schneier&#8217;s&nbsp;Law</h2>
<p>No discussion of the security mentality can be complete without a
mention of <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schneier%27s_law#Cryptography">Schneier&#8217;s Law</a>. While initially posed in relation to
cryptography, it is equally applicable to the general problem addressed
by the security&nbsp;mentality:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any person can invent a security system so clever that he or she
can&#8217;t imagine a way of breaking&nbsp;it.</p>
<p class="attribution">&mdash;Schneier&#8217;s Law (as coined by Cory&nbsp;Doctorow)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The advice is that security should be done in teams and made available
for peer review. This is because individuals are incapable of
considering every possible security threat; they are further constrained
by their assumptions and&nbsp;biases.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_de_Bono">Edward de Bono</a> at least partially addresses this problem in what he
calls <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_thinking">parallel thinking</a>. Parallel thinking can be viewed as an
extension to lateral thinking where the thinking process is performed as
a group and focuses on exploring&nbsp;possibilities.</p>
<p>The next step is to start exploring some of these common biases that
lead to vulnerabilities. My hope is that if we can understand <strong>why</strong>
developers make security mistakes (besides pure negligence), we should
be able to adapt our approaches to software assurance and education to
minimize security&nbsp;risk.</p>
