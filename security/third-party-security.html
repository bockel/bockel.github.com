    <p>Many applications rely on externally developed code and libraries to
support certain functionality. Examples include the integration of
Apache or other webserver to provide browser-based configuration or the
use of parsing libraries such as <tt class="docutils literal">libxml</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">expat</tt> to efficiently
handle&nbsp;<span class="caps">XML</span>.</p>
<p>While use of these third party packages decrease development time and
produce better products, they do have a drawback &#8212; your application
inherits the vulnerabilities and weaknesses of the third party&nbsp;code.</p>
<p>In general, there are two different ways to integrate third party code
into an application: <strong>embedded source</strong> or <strong>linked library</strong>. Each
option has its own benefits, shortcomings, and customer&nbsp;impact.</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="37%" />
<col width="20%" />
<col width="20%" />

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>It really comes down to a choice between <em>security</em> versus <em>stability</em>.
In order to keep an application functional, many vendors prioritize&nbsp;stability.</p>
<div class="section" id="embedded-source">
<h2>Embedded&nbsp;Source</h2>
<!-- + flexibility (license dependent)
+ opportunity to apply fixes and test
- delays increase customer risk
- more tedious than linking -->
<p>One option involves the literal copying of the source code or
application libraries into the application distribution. That is, the
application and all of its third party dependencies are shipped as a
single, integrated&nbsp;unit.</p>
<p>Embedding the source with the application gives the developers some
flexibility to modify the existing code to better suit their needs
(license dependant). By having control over this integration, the
developers have time to throughly test any patches or other changes
before publishing&nbsp;updates.</p>
<object data="/static/images/third_party_security-embed.anim.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
Embedding Third Party Code</object>
<p>On the down side, managing embedded code is tedious. Developers are
responsible for tracking the third party applications for security and
other fixes that may affect their application. This is compounded by the
fact that some third party code do not make priority fixes clear, so
security fixes may be hidden within other functionality&nbsp;updates.</p>
<p>Furthermore, once a security fix occurs in a third party library, the
developers are responsible for applying that fix to their application.
Until they update the embedded code and publish an updated application,
all of their customers are at risk and vulnerable to the security&nbsp;issue.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="linked-library">
<h2>Linked&nbsp;Library</h2>
<!-- + not responsible for external code
+ automatically get patches (when platform is updated)
- no control
- updates may be incompatible, break app
- not user-friendly; dependency hell; requires package management -->
<p>The other option for integrating third party code or libraries is to
build the application with links to the dependent libraries. By using
linked libraries instead of embedding them, the third party code is kept
external to the application. The linked library model is frequently used
by <span class="caps">RHEL</span> and can be seen in many open source&nbsp;projects.</p>
<p>Since the dependencies are external, the responsibility for tracking and
maintaining that third party code shifts from the developer to the
platform maintainer. Unlike the embedded model, linking does not require
developers to push out application updates to handle patches in third
party&nbsp;code.</p>
<object data="/static/images/third_party_security-link.anim.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
Linking Against Third Party Code</object>
<p>One issue with using linked libraries is that the developers forfeit
control over the linked dependencies. They have no control over when or
how the linked libraries may be updated. Making sure that the
application is linked against the correct versions of the right
libraries (and all cascading dependencies are properly resolved) is a
difficult problem that is beyond the capability of most users. Tools
such as package managers are required to help determine all of the
dependencies and ensure the right libraries are&nbsp;available.</p>
<p>In terms of security, having applications capable of sharing the same
linked libraries and having the update process managed externally should
yield improved security. However, in order to take full advantage of
these updates, an application must not be dependent on a specific
version of a third party library. By permitting this flexibility, the
application developers can benefit from updates by are taking a risk
that a future update to one of these linked libraries could break the
stability of their application. As there are no third party
compatibility guarantees, an update could change an <span class="caps">API</span> or modify the
behavior of a utilized feature; this would negatively impact the
customer necessitating an application&nbsp;update.</p>
